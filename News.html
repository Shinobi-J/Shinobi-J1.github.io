                  <p class="card-text">Sony’s original PlayStation exclusivity deal for Grand Theft Auto 3 and the following two games in the series was in part a reaction to concern about Microsoft’s launch of the Xbox, a former executive has revealed.

                    Speaking to GamesIndustry.biz, former PlayStation Europe boss Chris Deering (who was recently criticized for saying laid off developers should “drive an Uber” or “go to the beach for a year”) admitted Sony was concerned about the November 2001 launch of the original Xbox, and sought exclusivity deals with third-party publishers to bolster the appeal of the PlayStation 2.
                    
                    "We were worried when we saw Xbox coming," Deering said. "We knew exclusivity was the name of the game in a lot of fields, like Sky TV with sports. Just as Christmas was approaching when Xbox would launch, a few of us went out to our favourite third-party publishers and developers, and we asked them, 'How would you like a special deal if you keep your next-generation game on PlayStation exclusive for a two-year period?' And one of the deals we made was with Take-Two for the next three Grand Theft Auto games. At the time, it wasn't clear that Grand Theft Auto 3 was going to be as huge as it was, because it used to be a top-down game.
                    
                    "It was very lucky for us. And actually lucky for them, because they got a discount on the royalty they paid. Those deals aren't uncommon in industries with platforms. Including today with things like social media."</p>

                  <p class="card-text">Ubisoft’s share price skyrocketed today amid intensifying rumors that Chinese megacorp Tencent is engaged in buyout talks.

                    The company behind Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six Siege has suffered a torrid year, with multiple studio closures, mass layoffs, and game shutdowns. The company’s next big game, Assassin’s Creed Shadows, was delayed into 2025, and Star Wars Outlaws failed to meet sales expectations.
                    
                    According to Reuters, Ubisoft shareholders are “considering” how to structure a possible buyout of the French company without reducing the founding Guillemot family’s control. The Guillemot family is the largest shareholder in Ubisoft and is reportedly in talks with Tencent and “other investors” as it seeks funding a management buyout. Tencent is the second-largest shareholder in Ubisoft with 10% and, according to Reuters, has yet to decide whether to fund the buyout.</p>
